# My CLI repo

\+This\ repo is \**an\ exercise\**\ intended to further familiarize 
myself 
with the CLI[^1].

It has been created using content from this [wonderbar 
page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

My goal is to use the CLI as much as possible, and therefore a GUI as less as possible.

Of course ... you are **NOT** allowed to scrowl down before checking my
